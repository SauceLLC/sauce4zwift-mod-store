                "notes": "version 1.6.6\n- adds the ability to save a points leaderboard score format for reuse on other events.  It also includes two pre-defined formats for ZRL and DRS.  Note that the ZRL format has a fin score of x..1 and I haven't implemented that x (meaning the number of racers) yet, hopefully I can get to it before finals in April.  Also note that if the DRS FIN score format is wrong, you can blame @Andrei H because it's a copy and paste from https://discord.com/channels/744994375469367316/1187497643946037259/1342448423672221736 \n- You can also import/export a score format to JSON for sharing with others.  I only do a very crude validation on the JSON when importing, I'll make this better in a future version (maybe).\n- the \"All categories\" option will only appear if all cats are doing the same route and number of laps"
