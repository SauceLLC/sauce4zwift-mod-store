The sample will show along the right hand side of the window.\n- Score formats for the points leaderboard and segment results can now be in MATLAB colon notation (ie. 20:-1:1 is the same as 20..1 or 20:-2:1 would be the same as 20..1 with a step of -2)\n- the Route Preview window now has an option to choose an event and pen and it will automatically select the route and if applicable the number of laps or custom distance.\n- various minor tweaks and fixes\n"
