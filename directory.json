                "notes": "version 1.6.9\n- adds the option to invert the X-axis distances on the route profile (count down instead of up)\n- adds an option to show the gap distance to any Robopacers.  Note that this is more of a rough estimate rather than something precise.  You might see that the RP is 10m behind you in Zwift while this might say 6m or 15m.\n- adds an option to show the distance to a segment finish rather than just the start.  You will see something like \"Fuego Flats: 300 / 800m\".  The units are always the same so for long segments, like Fuego Flats reverse it could show 300m / 7400m but once you are in the segment it will switch back to km.\n- points leaderboard will prioritize highlighting Teammates over Marked riders\n- points leaderboard will match partial team names by default.  So if your team is (Team) and someone has theirs as (Team/Other) then it will still match.\n- points leaderboard has an option to rotate displaying the total scores for the event and the scores just for the last segment.  Note that last segment means the last segment that anyone went through, not necessarily the last one that you went through (don't get dropped!)\n- points leaderboard does some background checking to see if anyone on the leaderboard has left the event.  It's not taking any action at this point but once I'm confident with it, you'll have the option to remove them from the scoring if they leave\n- updated data for the new pens in France\n- Hopefully fixed the issue some people have seen in longer multi-lap events where the route profile just stops updating progress."
