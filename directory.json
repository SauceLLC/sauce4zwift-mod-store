Useful for on/off type of workouts.\n- Points Leaderboard has an option to monitor all categories in an event (only if all cats are doing the same route and number of laps).  Only the points for the your category are displayed but the others are recorded and available in the Analysis window.\n- Points Leaderboard will refresh quicker (within 5s) after going through a segment - requires an elevation profile window to be running.\n- Team badges in the segment results window are now right aligned and the size is configurable in the options\n- Names in both the segment results and points leaderboard are now clickable and will bring up the Sauce athlete window.\n- Fixed an issue with the segment results window that was causing very slow updates when there were a lot of names to display."
