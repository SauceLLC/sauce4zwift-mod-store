                "notes": "version 1.6.8\n- added a line spacing option to the points leaderboard and segment results windows to let you control the spacing between lines, allowing you to fit more entries in a window if desired.\n- added an option to the points leaderboard to show a preview of some sample data. This will let you adjust the font sizing, line spacing etc. before an event without having to wait for actual data in the event.\n- in the points leaderboard settings, you can control who will be marked as being on your team. There is a text box beside the option to highlight teammates and in there you have multiple options for who to include/exclude.  \n\t- Any words will do partial matches to a team tag.  In the screenshot, having \"sisu\" matches both \"sisu\" and \"sisu/rogue\", it would also match \"team sisu\" but would not match \"teamsisu\"\n\t- Any Zwift IDs will be added to your team (see 332952 in the screenshot)\n\t- Any Zwift IDs with a - in front of them will be excluded from your team, even if they match for a team tag (see -848974 in the screenshot which is excluded even though they match \"sisu\"\n\t- The upper right part of the settings window will show you who matches your team criteria.  You can click the \"Other entrants\" to see everyone registered for the event if you want to see team tags and Zwift IDs to include\n- added an option to show team score in the points leaderboard.  If enabled, the top line of the list will show the combined points totals for your team as shown in the screenshot.\n- fixed an issue that sometimes caused the elevation profile window to be blank when initially starting Sauce.  I hope this fixes the cases where others were seeing it, please let me know if not and if possible, press F12 on the window and go to the console tab to see what is going on there."
