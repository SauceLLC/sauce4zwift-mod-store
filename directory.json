                "notes": "version 1.7.7 is entirely Points Leaderboard/Analysis changes.\n\n- changed the default FAL score format for ZRL from 20..1 to x..1\n- if a score format has a letter (any letter, upper or lowercase) at the start like the x..1 for ZRL above, the number of known racers will be used for the starting score.  ie. for x..1 if there are 27 known racers then the format will be 27,26,25,... down to 1.  On the sample preview window, the number of people signed up for the race will be used.  \n- the points analysis screen will properly score formats like x..1\n- the points analysis screen will properly score FTS per event (ie. ZRL)\n- the points analysis screen has a save icon along the top bar that will export a JSON file containing the breakdown of points by racer, by segment, as well as the raw segment results data\n- the points analysis options now let you change the font size and theme\n- fixes for a few edge cases\n"
