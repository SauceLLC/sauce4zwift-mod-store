                "notes": "version 1.64 is mostly improvements (I hope) to the segment results multilap window\n- when crossing the finish line of an event that also finishes at a segment, the segment results window will keep showing results from the event rather than switching out to the default world one\n- in events that are longer than an hour, segment results should work properly now.  Prior to this, after around an hour the segment results start aging out of the results from Zwift which messed up counting how many times racers had been through a segment.  Results are now stored locally so they should persist and work properly.  I didn't give this a lot of testing as the opportunity to watch events that go longer than an hour is limited and when I had to fix something, I often had to wait for another event (and then wait for the hour to go by).\n- the points leaderboard window no longer relies on having an active elevation profile window\n- fix for the points leaderboard when the number of racers matches the number of point values. ie. 10 racers and point scores of 10..1 would assign 0 to the 10th rider.\n- fixes for custom POI creation and improperly displaying powerups when a custom POI was next on the route"
