You can control what you want the increments to be or if it's set to 0, it will auto-scale based on the length of the route or zoomed section\n- in the lap data window, clicking the \"Auto lap power\" field or pressing 'a' (if the window has focus) will toggle it on/off\n- added options for the max elevation line to show your current altitude and the route maximum altitude when zoomed in. It will display as altitude / view max / route max (if view max and route max are the same, it only shows it once)\n- general optimizations to remove unnecessary calculations when zoomed in\n\n"
